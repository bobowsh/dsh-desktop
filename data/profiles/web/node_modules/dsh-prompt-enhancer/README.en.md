# dsh-prompt-enhancer

A DeepSeek Harness (DSH) plugin with **two core capabilities**:

- ✨ **Prompt enhancement** — rewrite composer drafts in place with one click, fully undoable
- 💬 **Voice recognition** — speech-to-text that stops on silence, with cloud / local dual engines; the transcript is filled into the draft

Plus a bundled standalone utility 🔁 **one-click restart for DSH service failures** (recover from the CLI even when the web UI is down).

## ✨ Two core features

### 1. Prompt enhancement (✨)

The ✨ button in the composer toolbar triggers an independent LLM call and rewrites the current draft in place; keep refining, undo anytime, or cancel while enhancing.

- **One-click enhance** — the ✨ button triggers an independent LLM call and replaces the draft; continue refining, undo anytime, cancel while enhancing
- **5 optimization modes** — Basic (direct) / Lite (previous-round context) / Standard (rules + retrieval) / Expert (task analysis + full retrieval) / One-click Publish (complete dev-spec generator)
- **Memory switch** — when on, pre-send rounds (optimize → edit → re-optimize) accumulate into a memory chain the next round replays and senses your edit direction; sending the message clears it; when off, nothing is read or written
- **Model chain** — try multiple models in order, reorder, toggle thinking, run inline connectivity tests

### 2. Voice recognition (💬)

The 🎤 record button beside the composer starts listening; the transcript (cloud Qwen3-ASR / local offline SenseVoice dual engines) → optional refinement (de-filler) → filled into the draft → can be enhanced with one click. **Stops automatically on silence** (VAD), audio stays in memory only and is never written to disk.

- **Dual engines** — cloud Qwen3-ASR / local offline SenseVoice (framework + optional download, slim release)
- **Stops on silence** — VAD silence detection, no manual stop needed
- **Hotkey wake** — recordable global hotkey, tap / long-press dual trigger
- **Transcript refinement** — optionally refine the transcript through the base LLM to remove filler words
- **Auto-enhance** — when on, filling the draft after recognition automatically triggers prompt enhancement

## 🔧 Other capabilities

- 🌐 **i18n** — follows the DSH interface language (中文 / English)
- 🔁 **One-click restart (standalone)** — restart DSH even when the web UI is down: double-click the desktop shortcut (whale icon) or invoke the CLI directly; supports service-managed and process-level fallback restart

## 🚀 Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Fishsb/dsh-prompt-enhancer#v3.3.1
```

Restart DSH (`dsh web`) after installing — the ✨ button appears in the composer toolbar.

> Requires [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) installed locally and `pnpm` in PATH.
>
> **Client compatibility (voice recognition)**: 🎤 voice input relies on the client injecting `inputActions.setDraft` (the official web client satisfies this); third-party clients implementing the same contract can load it, and when the capability set differs, voice input **degrades gracefully** (no insert capability → transcript appended to the end of the draft; no injection at all → 🎤 disabled with a notice). The **local offline engine uses a "framework + optional download" model**: the plugin ships **without** and does **not** auto-download models; go to Settings → Model configuration → 💬 Voice recognition → set engine to "Local" → in the "Local model" area click **Download model** (SenseVoice 228MB, with progress), and it takes effect automatically when done. See [docs/map/flow/voice-input.md](docs/map/flow/voice-input.md).

Update / remove:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-prompt-enhancer
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-prompt-enhancer
```

> After `remove`, restart DSH to fully unload the running instance.

## 🔁 One-click restart (standalone)

Restart DSH even when the service is broken and the web UI is unreachable — no browser, no 3080 port required. In plugin settings, click "**Desktop**" on the "Restart port" confirmation to create a whale-icon "Restart DSH" shortcut; double-click it to restart with live progress. No shortcut needed either — run from any command window:

```sh
node "<DSH_HOME>\AppData\Local\dsh-prompt-enhancer\executor\0.1.11\lib\updater-host.cjs" --cli restart --service dsh-web --profile web
```

## 📦 Library notes

Core logic lives in standalone Node modules, reusable from other scripts: `lib/shortcut-win.cjs` (Windows shortcut generation), `lib/updater-host.cjs` (CLI restart / update executor), `lib/platform-service.cjs` (cross-platform service management), `lib/sys.cjs` (env & paths). See each module's header comments.

## 🎯 Usage (prompt enhancement)

1. Type any non-empty text (slash commands keep their prefix; only the body is optimized)
2. Click the **✨** button
3. Wait for the independent LLM call; the draft is replaced with the enhanced version
4. Not satisfied? Click **Undo** to restore the original

## ⚙️ Configuration

Settings → "Models & plugins":

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Model configuration** | Configure the optimization model chain: tried in order, reorderable; the **Voice recognition** section (engine switch / hotkey wake / local model download / refinement) |
| **Optimization parameters** | Mode / memory switch / context budget / timeout & output limits / templates |
